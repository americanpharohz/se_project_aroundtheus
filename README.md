# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is my 3rd Project of web development @TripleTen. I created it using Figma design, HTML & CSS from scratch.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma - I was able to find all requirments of the project of figma and displayed it correctly on my Project.
- Images - All logos and features were downloaded as a SVG as required on the brief and all other pictures were in PNG.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
